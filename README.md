# Building-visuals-in-Tableau-to-convey-some-insights.
Use Tableau to build dashboards and worksheets explanatory visualizations.
**In this project I use the owesome visualization tool `Tableau` to answer some questions on `flights`, this data comes from a Kaggle dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data)- it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015,.**
> **Through this analysis we find out:**
- states with the most and least total delay time,
- difference in total delay time among months,
- airlines have the most and least delay and flight cancelations,
- total number of cancelations in days of week.
#### The Markdown of `Insights of flights dataset` is a report of the project including links to the dashboards and worksheets in Tableau Puplic, brief summaries and the design followed in the visuals.
